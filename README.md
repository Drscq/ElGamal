# ElGamal Cryptosystem Implementations in C++ (On Going)

Welcome to the repository for the ElGamal cryptosystem implementations. This project contains implementations of the standard ElGamal cryptosystem, the exponential ElGamal cryptosystem, and their elliptic curve-based variants in C++. These implementations are designed for cryptographic research and educational purposes, providing a solid foundation for understanding and working with the ElGamal cryptosystem in both prime fields and elliptic curve settings.

## Features

- **Standard ElGamal Cryptosystem**: A basic implementation of the ElGamal encryption scheme over a prime field, providing secure encryption and decryption functions.
- **Exponential ElGamal Cryptosystem**: An advanced variant of ElGamal that supports homomorphic properties, useful for performing operations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first.
- **Elliptic Curve-based ElGamal Cryptosystem**: Implementations of both the standard and exponential ElGamal schemes utilizing elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), offering stronger security with smaller key sizes.
- **C++ Implementation**: All cryptographic schemes are implemented in C++ with a focus on efficiency and clarity, making the codebase suitable for both study and practical use.
  
## Contents

Working on it.

<!-- - `ElGamal_standard.cpp`: Implements the standard ElGamal encryption and decryption processes over a prime field.
- `ElGamal_exponential.cpp`: Implements the exponential variant of the ElGamal cryptosystem, including homomorphic operations.
- `ElGamal_elliptic_standard.cpp`: Implements the standard ElGamal cryptosystem using elliptic curves.
- `ElGamal_elliptic_exponential.cpp`: Implements the exponential ElGamal cryptosystem using elliptic curves.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases for each of the implementations to ensure correctness and performance benchmarks. -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<!-- To compile and run the code, youâ€™ll need:

- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later.
- OpenSSL library (for handling cryptographic operations).
- NTL library (for number theory operations). -->

### Building the Project

To build the project, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ElGamalCryptosystem.git
cd ElGamalCryptosystem
make
```

### Running Tests

You can run the provided test cases to verify the implementations:

```bash
./tests/run_tests
```

## Usage

Each implementation comes with a set of examples demonstrating how to use the cryptosystems. For detailed instructions, please refer to the comments within each source file.
